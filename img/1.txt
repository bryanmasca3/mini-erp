With a supportive husband urging her to fight the Establishment for equal pay, the fiercely private King was also struggling to come to terms with her own sexuality, while Riggs gambled his legacy and reputation in a bid to relive the glories of his past. Together, Billie and Bobby served up a cultural spectacle that resonated far beyond the tennis courts and animated the discussions between men and women in bedrooms and boardrooms around the world.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

One by one, each is drawn into the very \"personal project\" Graham is working on, leaving the relationships between them forever transformed. A monumental debut effort from first-time feature director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Twelve, Traffic, Erin Brockovich), this comic original includes riveting performances from Peter Gallagher (American Beauty), Andie MacDowell (Michael) and Laura San Giacomo (TV's \"Just Shoot Me\")."},

They hailed from the rural South, steel towns, and the San Fernando Valley. As teenagers, and young adults, none of them thought that porn was in their future. They were artists, baseball players, child prodigies, and even Ivy Leaguers. Now, after their lives in porn; they’re TV stars, bounty hunters, writers, and social activists. What happened in between? And now that they’ve moved on, can they really live a normal life after porn?"},

(this episode has a classy Shakespearean tone), 'What is Sodomy?', 'Why Some Women Have Trouble Reaching Orgasm,' 'Are Transvestites Homosexuals?' and a grand finale: 'What Happens During Ejaculation?' in which Tony Randall is an inside- the-body sperm-bank operator who sends Woody out as Sperm No. 2--an excellent position--except that almost-triumphant sperm Woody finds himself up against a 400-foot diaphragm!...

With 27 million victims, human trafficking is the 2nd largest criminal enterprise in the world. Not just a back-alley enterprise in underdeveloped regions, it’s also prevalent in the U.S. and industrial nations. Stopping Traffic takes an unflinching, first-hand look at this shadowy underworld, telling the shocking story through the eyes of survivors, veteran activists, front-line rescue organizations and celebrities who support the cause, including Dolph Lundgren and Jeannie Mai."},

Meanwhile, Matt's other boyfriend (Jonny Galecki) blames Bill for his disappearance, and gets even by pushing for an investigation by the local sheriff (Lyle Lovett) who, incidentally, carries a torch for Bill's best friend Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), a wickedly acid spinster who disapproves of everything Dedee does - and hey, who can blame her?

But, ultimately, it's the story of six confused, touching, and hilarious people who eventually stumble into what they've wanted all along: loving, committed relationships - what Dedee calls \"the opposite of sex.\""},

Morgan is an aspiring publisher who struggles to make ends meet the only way she knows how (as a sex worker) until she encounters the charming and unpretentious Lowick. As Morgan falls in love for the first time, Casey begins to unravel as her self-diagnosis becomes a consistent stream of cocktails while grappling with the resurgence of her clinical depression. Sage, a morose artist, battles her own demons feeling eternally bound to misery and a minimum wage paycheck until the flirtatious banter with one of her co-workers breaks down her walls. Through the journey of friendship, this edgy, honest and relatable film brandishes the flaws of the human condition and the inevitable mistakes we make in life which do not define us."},

Capturing moments of joy and struggle, this film follows the characters as they navigate their lives as artists, daughters, mothers, writers, and women who have made careers in the adult industry. Asked to defend their choices to their families, communities, and even the United States Government, these women share their unique motivations and shifting visions for the future. Most mainstream media depictions of porn stars tell tragic stories of addiction and desperation. Public Sex, Private Lives goes deeper, revealing not only the stigma that comes with being a sexually open woman in American society today, but also the pleasure and meaning these women get from their work in the adult industry. The film is about the balancing acts they must play as they navigate multiple identities that the world wants us to believe are at odds."},

But it's downright ironic that she learns it all from the head of a high-priced escort service. Joanna Taylor (Linda Hamilton, \"Terminator 2\"), whose husband has just left her for a younger woman, is a prominent New York journalist assigned a story on Paris' most secretive and successful madam. Though not interested at first in writing this \"sexpose\", she realizes that a month in the City of Lights might do her good. Soon after meeting the sophisticated and wise Madame Simone (Jacqueline Bisset, \"Joan of Arc\"), Joanna finds herself the one being interviewed. It doesn't take long for this worldly madam to size up Joanna and strip away her cold veneer. What is revealed is simply an insecure woman who needs to feel desirable again. Like a modern day Pygmalion who educates and refines beautiful young women, Madame Simone offers her expertise in helping Joanna rediscover her sexuality and sense of self. With Paris as the perfect backdrop, Joanna undergoes a physical and emotional transformation that leaves her empowered, confident and looking great. So as the writer becomes the subject, Joanna searches to create a happy ending for all before returning home. She succeeds by digging into Madame Simone's past and finding the only way to repay this woman who has helped so many others find happiness and true love."},
